# ü™ô CoinFlip Game DApp

## Project Description

CoinFlip Game DApp is a decentralized gambling application built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity smart contracts. Players can place bets on coin flip outcomes (heads or tails) and potentially double their wagered amount. The game uses blockchain's inherent randomness and transparency to ensure fair play, with all transactions and outcomes recorded on-chain for complete transparency and immutability.

The smart contract manages the entire game logic, from bet placement to payout distribution, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries and providing a truly decentralized gaming experience.

## Project Vision
